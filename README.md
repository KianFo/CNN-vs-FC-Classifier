CNN vs. Fully Connected Networks – Deep Learning Comparison

This project compares the performance of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Fully Connected Neural Networks (FCNs) on the CIFAR-10 image dataset.
The notebook includes complete model implementations, training loops, evaluations, and written analysis for understanding why CNNs outperform FC architectures on image-based tasks.

Highlights

Implemented using PyTorch

Trains both:

A Fully Connected Network built from linear layers

A Convolutional Neural Network with modern components

Works with CIFAR-10: a 10-class dataset of 32×32 color images

Includes:

Preprocessing & normalization

Training and testing phases

Accuracy tracking

Loss curves

Observations and explanations

Structured as a clear analysis notebook for coursework
